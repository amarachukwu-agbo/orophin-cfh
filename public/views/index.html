            We're quite sure you feel the same way, so we've integrated donation widgets (via
            <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/cfhio/fundraiser/cards4humanity">crowdrise.com</a>), along with some not-so-subtle reminders throughout the game to give you the opportunity to
            donate. If you're signed in when you donate, we'll even upgrade your account and place a crown on your avatar's
            head (to remind other players how much better you are than them). All donations go to the Make-a-Wish Foundation
            and benefit children in need.
